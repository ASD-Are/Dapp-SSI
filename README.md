**Repository Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for our comprehensive decentralized Metaverse architecture, implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. Our architecture integrates Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles and Web 3.0 technologies, aiming to enhance security and trustworthiness in the decentralized Metaverse. This framework is designed to foster a more immersive and secure online environment.

*Architecture Components*
The architecture consists of three main components:

*Mobile Wallet Provider dApp:*
This decentralized application (dApp) serves as a mobile wallet provider, allowing users to manage their digital assets securely.
Implemented using [specific technologies, e.g., Solidity, React Native].
Features include [list key features, such as asset management, transaction history].

*Virtual Environment (VE):*
A dynamic and immersive Virtual Environment for user interaction within the Metaverse.
Built using [technologies like Unity, Unreal Engine].
Incorporates [features such as real-time interaction, 3D visualization].

*Backend System on Ethereum Smart Contract:*
The core of our architecture, implemented as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
Handles [key functionalities like asset transfers, authentication].
Developed in [programming language, e.g., Solidity] with [additional tools or frameworks].
